#Multi-harvest settings

	# From lesser to greater, Vanilla tiers are: "wood", "stone", "iron", "diamond", "gold", "netherite".
	# When set to "none", multi-harvest will be enabled without a tool too. Note that [require hoe] takes precedence.

	# "small" - small increment, the size of the area, starting from [starting harvest area size], increases by 2 with each higher tier.E.g. 1x1 -> 3x3 -> 5x5 -> ...
